# Simple LineageOS Updater Server

This is a simple updater server/service for LineageOS roms (or anything that uses their API). This project aims to provide a much simpler service compared to the [official LineageOS server](https://github.com/lineageos-infra/updater). We do that by not requiring any external services or database backends in order to run this service.

You'll need `python3` with `flask` and `flask_compress` installed, you're on your own to figure out how to do that or until someone gets the ambition to make this README better.

Consider this project a WIP. Feel free to submit pull requests.
